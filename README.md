# Dotfiles

## Preamble:

I have this configuration installed on Linux running [XFCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce) on top of the the [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).

## Contents: 

- [Terminal Emulator Config](terminal/README.md)  

- [Vim Config](.vim/README.md)  

- [Vimperator Config](.vimperator/README.md)  

- [X Window System (.Xmodmap, et.al) Config](x/README.md)

## What each does:

### Bashrc / Inputrc (Linux Specific)

Sets bash to run in vi-mode. Here are a couple articles on that:
[Working Productively in Bash's Vi Command Line Editing Mode](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-vi-editing-mode-cheat-sheet)
[Vi mode in Bash](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vi-mode-in-bash)

### Vim

The vim setup here should work on a Mac and even on a Windows box, but I haven't used it in those environments so there may be some tweaking needed. 

### Vimperator

Vimperator is a dead project and I've begrudgingly moved to Vimperator, but I'll keep the config here for now anyway.

### X (Linux Specific)

This is where I have stored files that allow me to remap the native hotkeys for Google Chrome (those which are otherwise can't be remapped).
